# stretch-the-kin

Bare-bones, personal workout app for Kinstretch.

## Development

```
cd web && yarn start
```

This will start sbt and Vite concurrently.

## Ideas

- [ ] Show preview of the next screen
- [ ] Tones stop playing towards the end of the workout / after returning from a different tab/app
- [ ] order of IR/ER vs left/right side is all wrong, sides should switch first then rotation directions
- [ ] setup times are a bit off
- [ ] show number of IR/ER round or at least mention sooner whether to stretch more or prep for liftoffs
- [ ] Keep screen on (wakeLock)
